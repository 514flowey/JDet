# JDet
## Introduction
JDet is Object Detection System  based on [Jittor](https://github.com/Jittor/jittor). 

**Features**
- Automatic compilation. Our framwork is based on Jittor, which means we don't need to Manual compilation for these code with CUDA and C++.
- 


## Getting Started
```shell
sudo python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 setup.py install  # for user
python3 setup.py develop  # for developer
```
